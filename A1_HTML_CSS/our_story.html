				<h2>The birth of Blue Beach Co</h2>
				<p>While our charity was established only in 2019, our passion for oceans and beaches goes back to 1999. This was the time around which Blue Beach Co founder Lorna Fay started to walk as an infant. Growing up beside the sea meant that much of these early days of walking and playing took place on Donabate Beach. From a young age, Lorna's parents taught her the imporance of <span>leaving no trace</span> when visiting the beach, due to the inevitable journey of beach litter back into the ocean.
				<br><br>
				Fast forward 20 years and after many beach clean ups with local friends, Lorna established a charity dedicated to the cause. 2 years old and 18 staff strong, Blue Beach Co is in its early days yet. In this short time, our efforts have been recognised by being longlisted for an Irish Charity Awards prize in late 2020, for utilizing the time during Covid-19 lockdowns to campaign and act towards cleaner environments.
